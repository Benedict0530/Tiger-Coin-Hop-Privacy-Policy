        <h2>Privacy Policy for Tiger Coin Hop</h2>

        <p>At Tiger Coin Hop, we prioritize and respect the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document provides a comprehensive overview of the types of information we handle, including data collected through analytics services like AppsFlyer. By using our app, you consent to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h3>1. Analytics and Data Collection</h3>
        <p>We use third-party analytics services, such as <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">AppsFlyer</a>, to collect and analyze data about app usage. This includes information such as the number of users, frequency of use, and interactions within the app. These analytics help us understand how users engage with our app, improve its functionality, and enhance user experience.</p>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We collect minimal information necessary to support the core functionalities of our app. This may include device information, such as the type of device, operating system, and unique device identifiers. We also collect app usage data, including frequency and duration of app use, features accessed, and user interaction patterns. This information helps us to improve app functionality, enhance user experience, and troubleshoot issues. Additionally, it enables us to provide personalized content and recommendations based on your preferences and usage patterns.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement a range of security measures to protect the information we handle. These measures include encryption of data during transmission, secure storage solutions, and regular security assessments. We employ industry-standard practices to safeguard your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. Despite our efforts, no security system is completely infallible, and we encourage users to be vigilant and take steps to protect their personal information.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Retention Policy</h3>
        <p>We adhere to a strict data retention policy to ensure that user data is only retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with legal obligations. We do not keep user data indefinitely on the off-chance that it may be valuable someday. Our policy applies whether we store user data on devices, our own servers, or in cloud platforms. After a specified period, we delete user data and associated metadata or cross-references, ensuring that no traces remain. In certain cases, de-identification of the data may be sufficient if there is no reasonable likelihood that the data can be re-identified and linked back to an individual or device.</p>

        <h3>5. Third-Party Disclosure</h3>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or trade your personally identifiable information with third parties, except as necessary to provide services to you or as required by law.</p>

        <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users who are minors according to the laws applicable in their jurisdiction. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take immediate steps to delete it from our systems.</p>

        <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When significant changes are made, we will notify users through our app or website, and update the policy document with the effective date of the changes.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies exclusively to information handled through our app and website and does not cover information collected offline or through other channels. Your continued use of our app constitutes your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>8. Contact Us</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tigercoinhop.com">privacy@tigercoinhop.com</a>. We are committed to addressing your inquiries promptly and transparently, and to ensuring that our practices align with your privacy expectations.</p>

        <h3>9. Consent</h3>
        <p>By using our app, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, and you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described herein. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please discontinue use of our app.</p>
